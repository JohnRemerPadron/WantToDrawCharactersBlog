      <p>Have you ever seen your favorite cartoon show, or animated movie, or comic book and thought, “man I really want to draw characters that look this good”. Now whether your using references or not, one thing you’ll come to find out, one way or another, is the importance of anatomy, and being able to draw simple 3d shapes in 3d space. Now anatomy can be a long road walked, but luckily with some basic knowledge and a good understanding of 3d forms in 3d space you can carry out a lot in your illustrative pursuits. In short, most of everything you may ever want to draw can be broken down into basic 3d shapes, and understanding these shapes will help you understand how to breakdown the things around us and the things you want to draw into these shapes. Below we have an example of some minor practice sketches of basic forms in 3d space.</p>

      <h2></h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <div class="fakeimg2" style="height:500px; width:100%; " align="center"></div>
      <p>Now that you have an idea of how some of these basic shapes look like, you now want to get into the habit of making these sketch sheets a normal practice, as it will help you work around difficult moments when trying to draw more complicated things down the road. Essentially you want to be able to take these shapes such as cubes, spheres, cones, blocks, and understand so well how they exist in a 3D space. Imagine one of these shapes floating in front of you and you want to draw if from every perceivable angle possible. Once you do these enough you can start trying to manipulate these shapes slightly, by elongating them, warping and twisting them, tapering them and just having fun. This is essential and good practice but also it is just a fun exercise to throw in your sketchbook. Below is an example of how these basic shapes can be applied to constructing a frame of a character or using it as a container to guide your drawing of an object in perspective such as a coffee mug.</p>

      <h5></h5>
      <div class="fakeimg3" style="height:700px; width:100%; " align="center"></div>
      <p>Above we have an example of how some of those cubes, spheres, and tubes can be used as a map for a character or other objects. Once a map, or mannequin is made using basic shapes and manipulated basic shapes, you can go back over and start adding details to make the character look less like a manikin and more like something that looks closer to the being your trying to represent. The great thing about this practice method is that, it’s meant to get you so familiar with these basic shapes that once you know them, and you have something in mind to draw, instead of thinking “how am I going to draw this”? Your brain will start already deconstructing whatever it is you want to draw into these basic shapes, thus reshaping your whole approach towards drawing the things you once thought you couldn’t! Learning how to spice up your character design and anatomy details will be its own pursuit, but with some basic knowledge in this method you’ll find that you’ll be able to understand how to draw people things and many different poses you may not have understood how to draw in your past!</p>
